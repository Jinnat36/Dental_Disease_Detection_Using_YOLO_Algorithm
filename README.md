# Dental Disease Detection Model

This project is an AI-powered tool designed to assist dentists in identifying common dental diseases early and accurately. By leveraging advanced technologies like machine learning, image analysis, and computer vision, this system simplifies the diagnostic process, making it efficient and reliable.

## Features

- **Detection of Four Common Dental Conditions:**
  - Cavities
  - Implants
  - Impacted Teeth
  - Fillings
- **User-Friendly Inputs:**
  - User name, age, gender
  - Tooth X-ray images
- **Detailed Output:**
  - Highlights affected teeth on the X-ray
  - Specifies the detected condition
  - Provides detection confidence as a percentage

## How It Works

1. **Input Data:**
   - User details (name, age, gender).
   - X-ray image of the teeth.
2. **Processing:**
   - The model analyzes the X-ray image using machine learning algorithms.
   - Identifies dental conditions with precision.
3. **Output:**
   - Highlights the affected tooth or teeth in the X-ray.
   - Names the detected condition for each affected tooth.
   - Provides a confidence percentage for each detection.

## Technology Stack

- **Machine Learning:** Model training and prediction.
- **Image Analysis:** Processing X-ray images.
- **Computer Vision:** Identifying abnormalities in dental structures.

## Goals

- To assist dentists in detecting dental diseases early.
- To improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.
- To enhance patient care with clear and reliable results.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/dental-disease-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd dental-disease-detection
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Upload user details (name, age, gender) and an X-ray image.
2. The model processes the image and displays results.
3. Review the output highlighting the affected teeth, the detected condition, and detection confidence.

## Future Scope

- Expand detection capabilities to include more dental diseases.
- Integrate with dental clinic management systems.
- Enhance model accuracy with larger datasets.
